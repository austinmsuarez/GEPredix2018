# Airis

Airis uses the combination of temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity readings provided by CityIQ nodes to monitor nutrient pollution. Specifically, the primary and secondary correlations of these readings with Nitrogen and Ozone reactions within the atmosphere and their additional relation of Phosphorus runoff, encompassing the summation of their influence on the environment. The sensor data, coupled with the sensorâ€™s location registry, is then used to detect, store, plot, and illustrate appropriate readings; producing a reliable, accessible, and comprehensible means to track current environmental trends; determine the efficiency and impacts of sustainable actions in place; and approximate future environmental effects and hazards. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
