# propel-shared-library
Simple groovy functions for use in any Jenkinsfile.
These functions are static functions that should be as simple as possible.
More info on Jenkins Shared Libaries is located here:
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

## Usage
This library can be configured as a global shared library in your Jenkins instance.
Give it a name that will be used when the library is imported.
For instance, if the library is configured with the name "devrel", then it can be imported into a Jenkinsfile with this line:

`@Library('devrel') _`


After it's imported, the functions can be invoked from inside a script block in the Jenkinsfile:

```
script {
    sample.hello("Greg")
}
```

## Extending
You can create a new groovy file in the `vars` directory to contain a group of similar functions.  The file name will be used in the Jenkinsfile when the function is invoked.  (See above.)  The `src` directory could be used to contain Classes if necessary, but we want to keep things simple and just use simple functions as much as possible.
